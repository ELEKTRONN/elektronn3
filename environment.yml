# Notes:
# - This file only lists packages that elektronn3 *directly* depends on.
#   Transitive dependencies will be resolved by conda.
# - Dependencies are not pinned to specific versions. The minimum versions
#   listed below are the ones that are known to work. If some package causes
#   problems, just downgrade to the minimum version that is documented here.
# - If you encounter problems with CUDA versions (unwanted up-/downgrades,
#   incompatible versions), make sure to pin the cudatoolkit package to
#   a version that is known to work with your GPU driver, for example if
#   you want to stay on CUDA 10.1, run the following commands:
#       conda config --add pinned_packages 'cudatoolkit=10.1'
#       conda update --all
