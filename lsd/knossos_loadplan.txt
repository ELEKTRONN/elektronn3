KssosLabels Klasse

ben√∂tigt
1) conf_path_label: Path to KNOSSOS .conf file corresponding to the labels
2) conf_path_raw_data: Path to KNOSSOS .conf file corresponding to the raw data
3) dir_path_label: Directory containing label kzip files

but there are no kzip files!?!?

the kzip files are only used to get the file bounds.

what are the file bounds?
Tuple of boundary coordinates (xyz) that constrain the region
of where patches should be sampled from within the KNOSSOS dataset.
E.g. ``bounds=((256, 256, 128), (512, 512, 512))`` means that only
the region between the low corner (x=256, y=256, z=128) and the
high corner (x=512, y=512, z=512) of the dataset is considered. If
``None``, the whole dataset is used.
(from KnossosRawData)

in the _get_data method from KnossosLabels the data is loaded via
data = self.kd._load_kzip_seg(zip_path, bounds[0], size,self.mag,padding=0,
                                                  apply_mergelist=False,
                                                  return_dataset_cube_if_nonexistent=False,
                                                  expand_area_to_mag=False)

but there is also a method from knossos_utils called load_seg(), which does not require
a kzip_file to be loaded. lets explore that one!!
