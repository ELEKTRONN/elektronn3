    """Splits a tensor into overlapping tiles and applies a function on them independently.

    Each tile of the output results from applying a callable ``func`` on an
    input tile which is sliced from a region that has the same center but a
    larger extent (overlapping with other input regions in the vicinity).
    Input tensors are also padded with zeros to at the boundaries according to
    the `overlap_shape``to enable consistent tile shapes.

    The overlapping behavior prevents imprecisions of CNNs (and image
    processing algorithms in general) that appear near the boundaries of
    inner tiles when applying them on a tiled representation of the input.

    This function assumes that ``inp.shape[2:] == func(inp).shape[2:]``,
    i.e. that the function keeps the spatial shape unchanged.

    Although this function is mainly intended for the purpose of neural network
    inference, ``func`` doesn't have to be a neural network but can be
    any ``Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]`` that operates on n-dimensional
    image data of shape (N, C, ...) and preserves spatial shape.
    ("..." is a placeholder for the spatial dimensions, so for example
    H(eight) and W(idth).)


    Args:
        func: Function to be applied on input tiles. Usually this is a neural
            network model.
        inp: Input tensor, usually of shape (N, C, [D,], H, W).
            n-dimensional tensors of shape (N, C, ...) are supported.
        tile_shape: Spatial shape of the output tiles to use for inference.
        overlap_shape: Spatial shape of the overlap by which input tiles are
            extended w.r.t. the output ``tile_shape``.
        out_shape: Expected shape of the output tensor that would result from
            applying ``func`` to ``inp`` (``func(inp).shape``).
            It doesn't just refer to spatial shape, but to the actual tensor
            shape including N and C dimensions.
            Note: ``func(inp)`` is never actually executed â€“ ``out_shape`` is
            merely used to pre-allocate the output tensor so it can be filled
            later.

            The model can be passed as an ``torch.nn.Module``, or as a path

        device: Device to run the inference on. Can be a ``torch.device`` or
            a string like ``'cpu'``, ``'cuda:0'`` etc.
            If not specified (``None``), available GPUs are automatically used;

                Can be an ``np.ndarray`` or a ``torch.Tensor``.
                Note that ``inp`` is automatically converted to
                the specified ``dtype`` (default: ``torch.float32``) before
                inference.
            batch_size: Maximum batch size with which to perform
                inference. In general, a higher ``batch_size`` will give you
                higher prediction speed, but prediction will consume more
                GPU memory. Reduce the ``batch_size`` if you run out of memory.
                If this is ``None`` (default), the input batch size is used

                The ``overlap_shape`` should be close to the effective receptive
                field of the network architecture that's used for inference.
                Note that ``tile_shape + 2 * overlap`` needs to be a valid
                input shape for the inference network architecture, so
                depending on your network architecture (especially pooling layers
                and strides), you might need to adjust your ``overlap_shape``.
                If your inference fails due to shape issues, as a rule of thumb,
                try adjusting your ``overlap_shape`` so that

                performance impact and can even raise OOM errors, so make

                If you know how many classes your model predicts
