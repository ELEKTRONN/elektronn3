    """Splits a tensor into overlapping tiles and applies a function on them independently.

    Each tile of the output results from applying a callable ``func`` on an
    input tile which is sliced from a region that has the same center but a
    larger extent (overlapping with other input regions in the vicinity).
    Input tensors are also padded with zeros at the boundaries according to
    the ``overlap_shape`` to enable consistent tile shapes.

    The overlapping behavior prevents imprecisions of CNNs (and image
    processing algorithms in general) that appear near the boundaries of
    inner tiles when applying them on a tiled representation of the input.

    By default this function assumes that ``inp.shape[2:] == func(inp).shape[2:]``,
    i.e. that the function keeps the spatial shape unchanged.
    If ``func`` reduces the spatial shape (e.g. by performing valid convolutions)
    and its output is centered w.r.t. the input, you should specify this shape
    offset in the ``offset`` parameter. This is the same offset that
    :py:class:`elektronn3.data.cnndata.PatchCreator` expects.

    It can run on GPU or CPU transparently, depending on the device that
    ``inp`` is allocated on.

    Although this function is mainly intended for the purpose of neural network
    inference, ``func`` doesn't have to be a neural network but can be
    any ``Callable[[torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]`` that operates on n-dimensional
    image data of shape (N, C, ...) and preserves spatial shape or has a
    constant ``offset``.
    ("..." is a placeholder for the spatial dimensions, so for example
    H(eight) and W(idth).)


    Args:
        func: Function to be applied on input tiles. Usually this is a neural
            network model.
        inp: Input tensor, usually of shape (N, C, [D,], H, W).
            n-dimensional tensors of shape (N, C, ...) are supported.
        tile_shape: Spatial shape of the output tiles to use for inference.
        overlap_shape: Spatial shape of the overlap by which input tiles are
            extended w.r.t. the output ``tile_shape``.
        offset: Determines the offset by which the output contents are shifted
            w.r.t. the inputs by ``func``.
            This should generally be set to half the spatial shape difference
            between inputs and outputs:

            >>> in_sh = np.array(inp.shape[2:])
            >>> out_sh = np.array(func(inp).shape[2:])
            >>> offset = (in_sh - out_sh) // 2

        out_shape: Expected shape of the output tensor that would result from
            applying ``func`` to ``inp`` (``func(inp).shape``).
            It doesn't just refer to spatial shape, but to the actual tensor
            shape including N and C dimensions.
            Note: ``func(inp)`` is never actually executed â€“ ``out_shape`` is
            merely used to pre-allocate the output tensor so it can be filled
            later.
        verbose: If ``True``, a progress bar will be shown while iterating over
            the tiles.

    Returns:
        Output tensor, as a torch tensor of the same shape as the input tensor.

class Predictor:
    """Class to perform inference using a ``torch.nn.Module`` object either
    passed directly or loaded from a file.

    If both ``tile_shape`` and ``overlap_shape`` are ``None``, input tensors
    are fed directly into the ``model`` (best for scalar predictions,
    medium-sized 2D images or very small 3D images).
    If you define ``tile_shape`` and ``overlap_shape``, these are used to
    slice a large input into smaller overlapping tiles and perform predictions
    on these tiles independently and later put the output tiles together into
    one dense tensor without overlap again. Use this features if your model
    has spatially interpretable (dense) outputs and if passing one input sample
    to the ``model`` would result in an out-of-memory error. For more details
    on this tiling mode, see
    :py:meth:`elektronn3.inference.inference.tiled_apply()`.

    Args:
        model: Network model to be used for inference.
            The model can be passed as an ``torch.nn.Module``, or as a path
            to either a model file or to an elektronn3 save directory:

            - If ``model`` is a ``torch.nn.Module`` object, it is used
              directly.
            - If ``model`` is a path (string) to a serialized TorchScript
              module (.pts), it is loaded from the file and mapped to the
              specified ``device``.
            - If ``model`` is a path (string) to a pickled PyTorch module (.pt)
              (**not** a pickled ``state_dict``), it is loaded from the file
              and mapped to the specified ``device`` as well.
        state_dict_src: Path to ``state_dict`` file (.pth) or loaded
            ``state_dict`` or ``None``. If not ``None``, the ``state_dict`` of
            the ``model`` is replaced with it.
        device: Device to run the inference on. Can be a ``torch.device`` or
            a string like ``'cpu'``, ``'cuda:0'`` etc.
            If not specified (``None``), available GPUs are automatically used;
            the CPU is used as a fallback if no GPUs can be found.
        batch_size: Maximum batch size with which to perform
            inference. In general, a higher ``batch_size`` will give you
            higher prediction speed, but prediction will consume more
            GPU memory. Reduce the ``batch_size`` if you run out of memory.
            If this is ``None`` (default), the input batch size is used
            as the prediction batch size.
        tile_shape: Spatial shape of the output tiles to use for inference.
            The spatial shape of the input tensors has to be divisible by
            the ``tile_shape``.
        overlap_shape: Spatial shape of the overlap by which input tiles are
            extended w.r.t. the ``tile_shape`` of the resulting output tiles.
            The ``overlap_shape`` should be close to the effective receptive
            field of the network architecture that's used for inference.
            Note that ``tile_shape + 2 * overlap`` needs to be a valid
            input shape for the inference network architecture, so
            depending on your network architecture (especially pooling layers
            and strides), you might need to adjust your ``overlap_shape``.
            If your inference fails due to shape issues, as a rule of thumb,
            try adjusting your ``overlap_shape`` so that
            ``tile_shape + 2 * overlap`` is divisible by 16 or 32.

            If ``offset`` (see below) is not ``None``, ``overlap_shape``
            can't be specified but it is configured automatically.
        offset:  Shape of the offset by which each the output tiles are smaller
            than the input tiles
            on each side. This applies for networks using valid convolutions.
            If ``offset`` is specified, ``overlap_shape`` (see above) can't
            be specified but is configured automatically.
        out_shape: Expected shape of the output tensor.
            It doesn't just refer to spatial shape, but to the actual tensor
            shape of one sample, including the channel dimension C, but
            **excluding** the batch dimension N.
            Note: ``model(inp)`` is never actually executed if tiling is used
            â€“ ``out_shape`` is merely used to pre-allocate the output tensor so
            it can be filled later.
            If you know how many channels your model output has
            (``out_channels``) and if your model
            preserves spatial shape, you can easily calculate ``out_shape``
            yourself as follows:

            >>> out_channels: int = ?  # E.g. for binary classification it's 2
            >>> out_shape = (out_channels, *inp.shape[2:])
        out_dtype: torch dtype that the output will be cast to
        float16: If ``True``, deploy the model in float16 (half) precision.
        apply_softmax: If ``True``
            (default), a softmax operator is automatically appended to the
            model, in order to get probability tensors as inference outputs
            from networks that don't already apply softmax.
        apply_argmax: If ``True``, the argmax of the model output is computed
            and returned instead of the class score tensor.  This can be used
            for classification if you are only interested in the final argmax
            classification. This option can speed up predictions.
            Note that since argmax is not influenced by softmax,
            ``apply_softmax`` can be safely disabled if ``apply_argmax`` is
            ``True``, even if the model was trained with a softmax loss.
        transform: Transformation function to be applied to inputs before
            performing inference. The primary use of this is for normalization.
            Make sure to use the same normalization parameters for inference as
            the ones that were used for training of the ``model``.
            See :py:mod:`elektronn3.data.transforms`. for some implementations.
            For pure input normalization you can use this template::

            >>> from elektronn3.data import transforms
            >>> # m, s are mean, std of the inputs the model was trained on
            >>> transform = transforms.Normalize(mean=m, std=s)
        augmentations: List of test-time augmentations or integer that
            specifies the number of different flips to be performed as test-
            time augmentations.
        strict_shapes: If ``False`` (default), force the ``output_shape`` to be
            a multiple of the ``tile_shape`` by padding the input. This allows
            for greater flexibility of the ``tile_shape`` but potentially wastes
            more computation (the padded region will be passed into the model
            but will later be discarded from the output tensor).
            If ``True``, incompatible shapes will result in an error.
        verbose: If ``True``, report inference speed.
        report_inp_stats

    Examples:
        >>> model = nn.Sequential(
        ...     nn.Conv2d(5, 32, 3, padding=1), nn.ReLU(),
        ...     nn.Conv2d(32, 2, 1))
        >>> inp = np.random.randn(2, 5, 10, 10)
        >>> predictor = Predictor(model)
        >>> out = predictor.predict(inp)
        >>> assert np.all(np.array(out.shape) == np.array([2, 2, 10, 10]))
