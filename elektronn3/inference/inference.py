    """Splits a tensor into overlapping tiles and applies a function on them independently.

    Each tile of the output results from applying a callable ``func`` on an
    input tile which is sliced from a region that has the same center but a
    larger extent (overlapping with other input regions in the vicinity).
    Input tensors are also padded with zeros to at the boundaries according to
    the `overlap_shape``to enable consistent tile shapes.

    The overlapping behavior prevents imprecisions of CNNs (and image
    processing algorithms in general) that appear near the boundaries of
    inner tiles when applying them on a tiled representation of the input.

    This function assumes that ``inp.shape[2:] == func(inp).shape[2:]``,
    i.e. that the function keeps the spatial shape unchanged.

    Although this function is mainly intended for the purpose of neural network
    inference, ``func`` doesn't have to be a neural network but can be
    any ``Callable[[torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]`` that operates on n-dimensional
    image data of shape (N, C, ...) and preserves spatial shape.
    ("..." is a placeholder for the spatial dimensions, so for example
    H(eight) and W(idth).)


    Args:
        func: Function to be applied on input tiles. Usually this is a neural
            network model.
        inp: Input tensor, usually of shape (N, C, [D,], H, W).
            n-dimensional tensors of shape (N, C, ...) are supported.
        tile_shape: Spatial shape of the output tiles to use for inference.
        overlap_shape: Spatial shape of the overlap by which input tiles are
            extended w.r.t. the output ``tile_shape``.
        out_shape: Expected shape of the output tensor that would result from
            applying ``func`` to ``inp`` (``func(inp).shape``).
            It doesn't just refer to spatial shape, but to the actual tensor
            shape including N and C dimensions.
            Note: ``func(inp)`` is never actually executed â€“ ``out_shape`` is
            merely used to pre-allocate the output tensor so it can be filled
            later.
        final_crop_enabled: If ``True``, crop the output to not include the
            overlap regions. If ``False``, ``func`` has is expected to handle
            cropping itself.
        verbose: If ``True``, a progress bar will be shown while iterating over
            the tiles.

class Predictor:
    """Class to perform inference using a ``torch.nn.Module`` object either
    passed directly or loaded from a file.

    Args:
        model: Network model to be used for inference.
            The model can be passed as an ``torch.nn.Module``, or as a path
            to either a model file or to an elektronn3 save directory:

            - If ``model`` is a ``torch.nn.Module`` object, it is used
              directly.
            - If ``model`` is a path (string) to a serialized TorchScript
              module (.pts), it is loaded from the file and mapped to the
              specified ``device``.
            - If ``model`` is a path (string) to a pickled PyTorch module (.pt)
              (**not** a pickled ``state_dict``), it is loaded from the file
              and mapped to the specified ``device`` as well.
        state_dict_src: Path to ``state_dict`` file (.pth) or loaded
            ``state_dict`` or ``None``. If not ``None``, the ``state_dict`` of
            the ``model`` is replaced with it.
        device: Device to run the inference on. Can be a ``torch.device`` or
            a string like ``'cpu'``, ``'cuda:0'`` etc.
            If not specified (``None``), available GPUs are automatically used;
            the CPU is used as a fallback if no GPUs can be found.
        batch_size: Maximum batch size with which to perform
            inference. In general, a higher ``batch_size`` will give you
            higher prediction speed, but prediction will consume more
            GPU memory. Reduce the ``batch_size`` if you run out of memory.
            If this is ``None`` (default), the input batch size is used
            as the prediction batch size.
        tile_shape: Spatial shape of the output tiles to use for inference.
            The spatial shape of the input tensors has to be divisible by
            the ``tile_shape``.
        overlap_shape: Spatial shape of the overlap by which input tiles are
            extended w.r.t. the ``tile_shape`` of the resulting output tiles.
            The ``overlap_shape`` should be close to the effective receptive
            field of the network architecture that's used for inference.
            Note that ``tile_shape + 2 * overlap`` needs to be a valid
            input shape for the inference network architecture, so
            depending on your network architecture (especially pooling layers
            and strides), you might need to adjust your ``overlap_shape``.
            If your inference fails due to shape issues, as a rule of thumb,
            try adjusting your ``overlap_shape`` so that
            ``tile_shape + 2 * overlap`` is divisible by 16 or 32.
        out_shape: Expected shape of the output tensor
            It doesn't just refer to spatial shape, but to the actual tensor
            shape including N and C dimensions.
            Note: ``model(inp)`` is never actually executed â€“ ``out_shape`` is
            merely used to pre-allocate the output tensor so it can be filled
            later.
            If you know how many channels your model output has
            (``num_classes``, ``num_out_channels``) and if your model
            preserves spatial shape, you can easily calculate ``out_shape``
            yourself as follows:
            >>> num_out_channels: int = ?  # E.g. for binary classification it's 2
            >>> out_shape = (inp.shape[0], num_out_channels, *inp.shape[2:])
        float16: If ``True``, deploy the model in float16 (half) precision.
        apply_softmax: If ``True``
            (default), a softmax operator is automatically appended to the
            model, in order to get probability tensors as inference outputs
            from networks that don't already apply softmax.
        verbose: If ``True``, report inference speed.

    Examples:
        >>> cnn = nn.Sequential(
        ...     nn.Conv2d(5, 32, 3, padding=1), nn.ReLU(),
        ...     nn.Conv2d(32, 2, 1))
        >>> inp = np.random.randn(2, 5, 10, 10)
        >>> model = Predictor(cnn)
        >>> out = model.predict_proba(inp)
        >>> assert np.all(np.array(out.shape) == np.array([2, 2, 10, 10]))
