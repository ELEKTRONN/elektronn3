"""
Implementation of a simple cross-platform file locking mechanism.
This is a modified version of code retrieved on 2013-01-01 from 
http://www.evanfosmark.com/2009/01/cross-platform-file-locking-support-in-python.
(The original code was released under the BSD License.  See below for details.)

Modifications in this version:
 - Tweak docstrings for sphinx.
 - Accept an absolute path for the protected file (instead of a file name relative to cwd).
 - Allow timeout to be None.
 - Fixed a bug that caused the original code to be NON-threadsafe when the same FileLock instance was shared by multiple threads in one process.
   (The original was safe for multiple processes, but not multiple threads in a single process.  This version is safe for both cases.)
 - Added ``purge()`` function.
 - Added ``available()`` function.
 - Expanded API to mimic ``threading.Lock interface``:
   - ``__enter__`` always calls ``acquire()``, and therefore blocks if ``acquire()`` was called previously.
   - ``__exit__`` always calls ``release()``.  It is therefore a bug to call ``release()`` from within a context manager.
   - Added ``locked()`` function. 
   - Added blocking parameter to ``acquire()`` method

WARNINGS: 
 - The locking mechanism used here may need to be changed to support old NFS filesystems:
   http://lwn.net/Articles/251004
   (Newer versions of NFS should be okay, e.g. NFSv3 with Linux kernel 2.6. Check the open(2) man page for details about O_EXCL.)
 - This code has not been thoroughly tested on Windows, and there has been one report of incorrect results on Windows XP and Windows 7.
   The locking mechanism used in this class should (in theory) be cross-platform, but use at your own risk.

ORIGINAL LICENSE:

The original code did not properly include license text.
(It merely said "License: BSD".)
Therefore, we'll attach the following generic BSD License terms to this file.
Those who extract this file from the lazyflow code base (LGPL) for their own use
are therefore bound by the terms of both the Simplified BSD License below AND the LGPL.
